Doing an easy project (with Electronic Playground 130) to figure out how this works

Over Thanksgiving break I finally had time to work on a dimmer switch project I’d been thinking about for awhile. Our kitchen lights are aggressively bright, my mom complains about how they feel painfully fluorescent all the time. I wanted to surprise her by installing a dimmer, but I didn’t want to mess with the house wiring without practicing first so I started with a kit version. This seemed like the safest way for me to learn the basics of how the switch worked before touching live wiring.
