# Dimmer_Switch_Project
Over Thanksgiving break I finally had time to work on a dimmer switch project I’d been thinking about for awhile. Our kitchen lights are aggressively bright, my mom complains about how they feel painfully fluorescent all the time. I wanted to surprise her by installing a dimmer, but I didn’t want to mess with the house wiring without practicing first so I started with a kit version. This seemed like the safest way for me to learn the basics of how the switch worked before touching live wiring. I asked my aunt who an engineer to help supervise this project since I wasn't intrested in electrocuting myself.

I started by using the Electronic Playground kit to practice working with a dimmer switch hands-on, even though it ended up not being the same type of dimmer I used later. This dimmer switch relied on how capacitors store energy to work. It was simple- flipping the switch on would store electricity in a capacitor, then when you flipped it off, the electrcity would slowly drain, resulting in the light slowly dimming.

I used circuit-diagram.org to better visualize the diagram before building the circuit. This made it easier to troubleshoot when something didn't work.

After finishing the kit, my aunt and I went to Lowe's to find the right type of switch for our kitchen. We chose a 3-way switch since the kitchen light is controlled by multiple switches, so a regular switch wouldn't work in this scenario.

Once we got back to the house, we started by turning off the circuit breaker for the kitchen. Then, we took the plate off the switch, and the first thing I noticed was the complete mess of wires- nothing like the neat and organized diagrams I had been looking at. I've always pictured eletrical work as careful and precise, so it was jarring to have to yank the box out of the wall to be able to work on it.

Now it was time to actually change the switch! First, I identified the black, red, and ground wires, and figured out where they were supposed to go. After this, I used wire-cutters to strip the insulating rubber down. I ended up having to redo this a few times because if you dont trim back enough insulation, the connection wont seat properly. I also used needle-nose pliers to curl the exposed wires into shape so I could put them on the new switch. I didn't do a very good job of this, however, because I ended up swapping the black and red wires. But don't worry! Nothing blew up- it just didn't work until we put the wires in their correct spots.

After getting all the wires into their correct places, we turned the circuit breaker back on to test the new switch- and it worked (the second time)! Our eyes would no longer bleed everytime we wanted to use the kitchen! Once we tested it, we turned the breaker back off one more time so we could safely put the switch back into the wall and replace the face plate. This ended up being much more difficult than expected. Turns out, the hardest part wasn't getting the wiring right, but actually trying to fit everything into that tiny hole in the wall. After ~~pushing the box back into the wall so hard my arms felt weak~~ some careful manuevering, we were able to get it back into place. After that, we re-attached the plate, and it was complete!
